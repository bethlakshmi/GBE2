Knowing there was more to be had in this expansive world, Miss Wilde was constantly reaching for the stars. Like the mythical Phoenix, Attica was to be reborn in a firestorm of glitter and rhinestones through the art of Burlesque dancing.\r\nAttica is completely self taught; learning the art through the rigorous studies of greats such as Dita Von Teese, Michelle L''amour, Angie Pontani, and of course Veronica Varlow, some trial and error, and hours of practice behind closed doors. Not content with simply imitating others, as “Imitation is suicide,” Miss Wilde could not help but to add her own charming personality to all of her performances. Attica has now come into her own as a confident entertainer, despite her small start. She has performed all over New Jersey, New York, and occasionally ventures as far as Baltimore. Even though she came so far in so little time, Attica can still remember the encouraging words Veronica Varlow spoke to her on a wintery night in New Jersey and, is eternally grateful for them.\r\nAttica finds herself more at home between the pages of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Classic, The Great Gatsby, than the in humdrum of modern day and, as a result, draws her aesthetics from the glamor of the 1920s. However, she is not a girl afraid to get her hands, hair, dress, or shoes dirty, and often draws influence for her acts from the classic horror movies which she adores. Do not fret, Attica is a woman who prides herself on her boundless class and style and, would only use gallons of glitter blood if she felt the act was tasteful.\r\nAttica is currently a member of Brunswick Basement Burlesque,  Ambience Artistry, and has been the guest of many others. Attica leads Smoke & Mirrors Peepshow, her own burlesque troupe in which she wears many hats from dancer to producer to stage manager, she is affectionately called "The Madame."
