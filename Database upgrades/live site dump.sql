From cosmetics to fashion accessories to memorabilia, our vendors sell it all, from family-friendly to risqué.  The Vendors'' Hall is ideal for merchants who sell smaller items or whose customers do not need to try on clothing.\nAll booth spaces are 8''x8'', about half are against a wall.  Each booth space comes with two chairs and four vendor badges.  Additional badges are available upon request.  As many of our vendors prefer to bring their own racks or displays, we do not automatically include tables with the rental of a vendor space.  Tables (3''x6'') with tablecloths are available in advance when you book your booth.\n\n<H3>Salon Vendors: </h3>\n<i>Please Note: You Must Rent A Hotel Room to Be A Salon Vendor</i>\nFor those vendors who wish a larger set-up, to set their own hours, or who have higher end or more custom products, we offer ''Salons'', the opportunity to vend your wares out of a hotel room.  All Salon vendors will be grouped together on the second floor, directly above the rooms used for the conference and adjacent to the hotel restaurant.  Signage throughout the event space directs attendees and hotel guests to the Salon Vendors.\nTo be a salon vendor you must both complete a vendor application with application fee and reserve a hotel room.
