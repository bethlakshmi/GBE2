Your privacy is very important to us. We promise that your information
will not be sold or traded. That said, we need your complete and
accurate contact information in order to alert you to important
aspects of the event: your ticket purchases and personal schedule,
news, events, and deadlines. Your profile information will be visible
to the department head associated with any role or activity you've
elected to be involved with (that is, if you're performing, our
selection committee and stage managers will be able to see your
profile information. If you're teaching, the conference committee
members and staff will be able to see your profile information,
etc.).
