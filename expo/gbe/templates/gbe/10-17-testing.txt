   - prompted for persona, made one
   - prompted for class, made one as draft
   - persona worked and is editable

   - submit fails (no poyment) as expected
   - hacked submit

   - proposed panel

As privileged user:
- reviewed act
- reviewed class
- published proposal
- applied to present
- reviewed volunteer
- reviewed vendor
- accepted vendor
- accepted class
- accepted show (bug)

BUGs -
- Betty has no items to review - when there are tons of bids I'm elible to review and have not reviewed.
- Can't change act state when no shows are set - something in the post value checking is creating an unslightly error.
