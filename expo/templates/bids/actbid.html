<h3><a name="deadlines">Application Hints</a></h3>
  <p>The selection committee wants you to perform, but they also want to create the 
    best show possible.  While some of the members of the committee may know you, most 
    of them won't, so your application is the only information they have about your act 
    and you as a performer.  When filling out the form, try and imagine how it reads to 
    someone who doesn't know you and has never seen your act.  Remember that we get 
    hundreds of applications; while we'd love to be able to follow-up and ask questions 
    on every submission, odds are we won't be able to.  If something isn't clear on your 
    application, you're less likely to be accepted.</p>
  <p> Submissions that have video go to the top of the pile.  Submissions that have 
    clear video of the act which is being submitted go to the top of the top of the 
    pile.  "Clear" video doesn't mean 'professional' video, it just means steady, 
    well-let, and in focus.</p>
  <p> <I>The Great Burlesque Exposition</I> does not have a preferred 'style' of act.  
    We like <em>good</em> acts, but besides that, all flavors of performance are welcome.</p>
  <p> Be careful not to paint yourself into a corner.  If you've been performing for 
    5 years, but only want to be considered for <I>The Original Newcomers' Showcase</I>, 
    or if your act is six minutes long, but you indicate you only want to be considered 
    for <I>The Main Event</I>, you've made our decision for us &mdash; and taken yourself 
    out of the running.</p>

  <h2>Apply to Perform</h2>

  <big>Thank you for your interest in applying to perform at <em>The ninth annual Great 
  Burlesque Exposition of  2015</em>.  </big>
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Incomplete applications will not be accepted</b>, but you can now save your application 
  and come back to complete it.  Also, every time you log in to the site, you'll get a notice 
  letting you know your application isn't complete.  <B>Applications are accepted from 
  September 1 through October 31 and performers are notified of acceptance on or about 
  December 1.</b><br />
  <br />
  <b>Unpaid applications will not be accepted</b> but we'll send you a reminder so 
  you can settle up before October 31st.<br />
  <br />
  <big>There are four potential performance slots for applicants on three nights:</big> 
  <br />

  <ul>
    <li><b>Friday night, February 7</b> during <i>The Burlesque Bordello</i>.  
      This isn't the same thing as <i>The Rhinestone Review</i> which is earlier in the 
      evening on Friday and invitation only.  Performances at <i>The Burlesque Bordello 
      Party</i> are on a small (8'x8') stage, are non-competition, and are best suited 
      for solos or duets.  This is limited to 10-15 acts of varying lengths. <em>We are 
      also accepting NON-burlesque variety acts for this show</em></li>
    <li><b>Saturday night, February 8</b> <i>The Main Event</i>, where you can perform 
      either in competition or in exhibition (while the judges or off selecting the 
      winners).  The competition portion of The Main Event is limited to about 25 acts 
      <b>each act in competition has a <u>maximum length</u> of four minutes and fifteen 
      seconds (04:15)</b>. Most people don't get in the first time they apply, so don't 
      feel badly if you don't get in.</li>
    <li><b>Sunday night, February 9</b> <i>The Original Newcomer's Showcase</i>  We don't 
      have a hard cut-off for what a 'newcomer' is.  We use our judgment based on the 
      biographical information you provide us. Someone who has been performing for only 
      a year but has already been in three festivals and dances regularly in a weekly 
      showcase is technically "newer" than someone who has been performing for three 
      years, but only performs once or twice a year.  We accept 10-15 performers for 
      this show.</li>
    <li><b>Sunday night, February 9</b> <i>The Sideshow Ball</i> is the other part of 
      Sunday's entertainment.  It's for freaks, geeks, and variety entertainers.  In 
      past years we've had belly dancers, snake charmers, magicians, mentalists, 
      comedians, grinder girls, sword swallowers, hula hoopers, watchamacallems and 
      thingamawhosits.  We accept 8-10 variety acts and intersperse them amongst the 
      burlesque newcomers.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br />
  <hr /><br />
  At minimum, before applying, you'll want:
  <ul>
    <li>To know which act you're going to submit</li>
    <li>A picture of yourself and a video (preferably of the act with which you are 
      applying)</li>
    <li>A little burlesque resume</li>
    <li>A PayPal account or credit card</li>
  </ul>
